.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hts-time
is a dual-mode utility for interacting with the Human Time System (HTS).
By default, the application detects its execution environment to provide the
most appropriate interface.

HTS is a chronological notation system designed for a 24-billion-year lifespan,
providing a consistent timeline for human civilization across vast eras.

graphical suite.
