.SH NAME
hts-time \- A specialized chronometry utility for the Human Time System (HTS)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hts-time
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hts-time
is an advanced temporal tracking utility designed by Antonio Storcke. It implements the
\fBHuman Time System (HTS)\fR, a chronological framework developed for long-term
civilizational stability, systems thinking, and organizational leadership.

Standard Gregorian calendars are often insufficient for tracking deep-time organizational
shifts. HTS addresses this by utilizing a significantly larger scale for time measurement,
anchoring modern history within a broader context of human development.

.SH THE ARCHITECTURE OF HTS
The system is built upon three primary pillars of measurement:

.TP
\fBThe Base Epoch\fR
The system is anchored to a start date of \fB-37,977 CE\fR. This point serves as the "Year Zero"
for the calculation of all subsequent human organizational eras.
.TP
\fBEpochs\fR
Time is divided into segments of \fB50,000 years\fR. Each Epoch is assigned a letter from
A to Z. The current era falls within Epoch A.
.TP
\fBSupercycles\fR
A Supercycle consists of a full 26-Epoch rotation, totaling \fB1,300,000 years\fR. This
scale ensures that chronological data remains stable and relevant for the foreseeable
future of human civilization.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-supercycle
Displays the architectural specifications of the HTS. This output provides the
mathematical constants used in the calculation, including the Supercycle duration
and the inventor's credentials.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Prints the software version (currently 0.1.0) and the build date.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Prints a summary of command-line arguments and usage patterns.
.TP
\fI(No Arguments)\fR
If executed without flags in a desktop environment, the application launches a
graphical user interface (GUI) powered by WebKitGTK, displaying a live dashboard
of the HTS clock.

.SH MATHEMATICAL LOGIC
The utility calculates the current HTS date by first determining the total years
elapsed since the Base Epoch:
.IP
\fITotal_Years = Current_Gregorian_Year - (-37,977)\fR
.PP
The Epoch Year is then derived using the modulo of the Epoch Duration:
.IP
\fIHTS_Year = Total_Years MOD 50,000\fR
