# hts-time

This is the Human Time System command-line tool and desktop app. Because of this app you can look forward to a future of never having to type or interpret long dates such as 
March 13 15,428,667,546 AD. 

As the author of this application, I can say that I am hopeful that humanity will exist on earth long enough to need this app or be on some other planet or realm to not have to worry about time and dates. If you are on Gnome-Builder, simply clone and run. This app will be available on Flathub, the Arch User Repository. And similar sources. 
After cloning and running in Gnome-builder, install in your system easily from Gnome-builder's terminal: 

Configure Native Build: meson setup _native_build

Compile: meson compile -C _native_build

Install System-Wide: sudo meson install -C _native_build


There has been a book written about this time system: The Unseen Clock MASTERING THE HUMAN TIME SYSTEM  A Foundational Technology for the One Millionth Century. By Antonio Storcke

 The system has been designed to get humanity to have simple, short dates up  12 billion and 24 billion years into the future and beyond. This time system is effectively eternal and has been designed to accompany users in the world of 64-bit computing. Storcke64 does have some very nice tools. Learn more about the system on Reddit.

Any AI system can implement this for you using the following parameters: 
The Storcke Human Time System- By Antonio Storcke. An infinite, cyclical calendar designed for deep time. It starts at A0 (40,000 years pre-2023) and uses Epochs lasting 50,000 years. Epochs use the Latin alphabet (A, B, C...) before cycling back to A. Current date: A40,000 (2023). Epoch A ends at A50,000 (12,023 CE), followed by B0.one supercycle is therefore 1,300,000 years and is marked by the end of epoch Z. There can be as many supercycles as needed.
